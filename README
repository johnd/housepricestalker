House Price Stalker!
--------------------

This is a wee Sinatra app that I'm going to use to obsessively track the
estimated value of my house. I have horrific negative equity and hate where
I live, so knowing the value of my house, particularly the trending
information I can easily see from a ling graph, is pretty important to me.

If it's important to you, fork this, change the appropriate things in the
example files in config/ and go to it!

This app isn't what you'd call polished. The code's pretty filthy and the
interface could use some more functionality. But my philosophy is to get
something done to the point I can use it as quickly as I can, since there's
no point polishing up something I won't actually ever use. Good enough is 
good enough.
